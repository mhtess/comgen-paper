It&quotechars kind of crazy how sometimes, I feel someone doesn&quotechart qualify for the label if they have only done something a few times, but other times they do. The volunteer one really hit home with me. I volunteer five days a week, and have been involved in animal rescue for 8 years. It drives me nuts when I see someone volunteer for a couple hours ONE time and talk about them being a volunteer. Not that we don&quotechart appreciate it, but come on. However, someone buying a pack of cigarettes once can be easily labeled as a smoker. Very interesting.","Yes","0.50",2
